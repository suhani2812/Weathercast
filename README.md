# WeatherCaste
The project involves developing a Flask application for providing live weather forecasts. The user interface will be designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing users to input their location or zip code to retrieve real-time weather data. The backend of the application will be built using the Flask framework, where the logic to fetch weather data from a weather API (such as OpenWeatherMap, Dark Sky, or AccuWeather) will be implemented. The application will handle user input, process the weather data, and display the current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other relevant information on the web interface.
